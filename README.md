But,  that change a future from legacy system and migrate to a digital core in the business itself would raise a marketing strategy by its own. When a range of considerations around whether a local system or a cloud system or adopting Blockchain technology and managing data by choosing the best approach to improve your business core system to compete further up in the years coming will be challenging. Adapting data analytics, probability algorithm to improve if a business core for global marketing purposes is a hard decision to make.
